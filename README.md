## Objective

In this challenge, my goal was to compare portfolios of prominent companies-Berkshire Hathaway, Paulson, Soros, and Tiger- to 
to the S&P 500 and two algorithmic trading strategies. I compared them with standard deviation (daily, annual, and rolling), 
correlation, beta, sharpe ratios, and exponentially weighted average. Then I plotted cumulative returns for all portfolios for
further comparison. I then used my analysis to give my opinion on how the algorithmic trading strategies compared to the 
portfolios.

Additionally, I made my own portfolio of three stocks-Tesla, Advanced Micro Devices, and Adobe- then compared them to the 
previously mentioned portfolios using the same metrics. I also plotted the cumulative returns of all portfolios to compare 
my portfolio to the rest. Lastly, I gave my interpretation of my portfolio compared to the rest.
