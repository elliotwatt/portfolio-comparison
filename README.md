## Objective

In this challenge, my goal was to compare portfolios of prominent companies-Berkshire Hathaway, Paulson, Soros, and Tiger- to 
to the S&P 500 and two algorithmic trading strategies. My comparison metrics were standard deviation (daily, annual, and 
rolling), correlation, beta, sharpe ratios, and exponentially weighted average. Then I plotted the cumulative returns of all 
portfolios to visualize the perfomances. Then, I used my analysis to give an opinion on how the algorithmic trading strategies 
compared to the portfolios and the S&P 500.

Additionally, I made my own portfolio of three stocks-Tesla, Advanced Micro Devices, and Adobe- then compared them to the 
previously mentioned portfolios and the S&P 500 using the same metrics. I also plotted the cumulative returns of all portfolios 
to compare my portfolio to the rest. Lastly, I gave my interpretation on how my portfolio compared to the rest.
